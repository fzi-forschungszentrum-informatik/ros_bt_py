    On the other hand, if more than N - `needed_successes` of its

    Different values of `needed_successes` can produce behavior
    similar to the "barrier" (wait until all actions are finished) and
    "heureka" (first success aborts all other actions) parallel
    programming primitives, and more.

    To prevent thrashing when multiple children return RUNNING for
    different lengths of time, a child that has returned SUCCEEDED or
    FAILED once will not be ticked again untill **all** children have
    reached a result.
